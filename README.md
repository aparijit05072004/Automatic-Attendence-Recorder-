# Automatic Attendance Recorder using RFID

## Overview

The Automatic Attendance Recorder using RFID is a system designed to streamline and automate the attendance recording process. This project utilizes Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to efficiently and accurately track attendance without manual intervention. The RFID technology allows for quick and contactless identification of individuals, making it an ideal solution for various environments such as classrooms, offices, and events.

## Features

- **RFID Technology:** The system employs RFID cards or tags for user identification, ensuring a quick and hassle-free attendance recording process.

- **Real-time Tracking:** Attendance is recorded in real-time, providing instant and accurate data on who is present.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system is designed with a user-friendly interface for easy setup and management. It includes options for adding and removing users, as well as generating attendance reports.

- **Scalability:** The system is scalable to accommodate varying numbers of users and RFID cards/tags.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Hardware:**
  - RFID Reader: Compatible with the RFID cards/tags used.
  - RFID Cards/Tags: Unique identifiers for each user.
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi): Controls the RFID reader and processes data.
  - Computer or server: For storing and managing attendance data.

- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE (if using Arduino) or suitable programming environment for the chosen microcontroller.
  - RFID library compatible with your RFID reader.
  - Database system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite) for storing attendance records.

### Installation

1. Connect the RFID reader to the microcontroller following the provided instructions.
2. Install the necessary RFID library in your programming environment.
3. Set up the database system and create a table to store attendance records.
4. Upload the provided source code to the microcontroller.

### Usage

1. Distribute RFID cards/tags to users.
2. When users enter the designated area, they can swipe or tap their RFID card/tag near the RFID reader.
3. The system will record the attendance in real-time and store the data in the database.
4. To view attendance records, use the provided interface or query the database directly.
